# Simple Calculator

## Description
A Beginner-friendly Python project that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes basic error handling to ensure smooth operation.

## Features
- Handles invalide numeric inputs.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Allows the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone or download the project files from this repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the program using:

```
Welcome to the Simple Calculator
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result is: 15.0
```

## Notes
- Avoid invalid operations (e.g., unsupported symbols like `%`).
- Multiplication by zero displays a helpful note for users.
- Division checks prevent errors caused by dividing by zero.

## Future Improvements
- Add a looping mechanism to allow multiple calculations in one session.
- Expand operations to include power/exponentiation and squre root calculations.
