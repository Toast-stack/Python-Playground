# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Description
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic and fun game where the player competes against the computer. This Python implementation is beginner-friendly, interactive, and provides instant results for each round. The game uses simple logic and randomization to mimic real-world gameplay.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Type your choice ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') to play.
- **Random Computer Choices**: The computer picks randomly for unpredictability.
- **Hint System**: Displays outcomes (win, lose, or tie) instantly.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that invalid choices are handled gracefully.
- **Replay Option**: Play as many rounds as you like by staying in the loop.

## How to Run
1. Install Python: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone the Repository: Download or clone this project to your computer.
3. Navigate to the Project Folder: Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `RPS.py`.
4. Run the game: Execute the script using:
```Bash
python RPS.py
```
## Example Gameplay
```
Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!
Type 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' to play. Type 'quit' to exit.

Your choice: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!

Your choice: paper
Computer chose: rock
You win!

Your choice: scissors
Computer chose: scissors
It's a tie!
```
## Concepts Covered
This project is an excellent introduction to:
- **Loops**: The game runs continuously until the user chooses to quit.
- **Conditional Statements**: Determine the outcome of each round.
- **Randomization**: Uses Python's `random.choice()` to generate computer choices.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user inputs and provides helpful feedback.

## Possible Enhancements
If you want to improve upon this project, try adding some of these:
1. **Score Tracking**: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties over multiple rounds.
2. **Best of X Rounds**: Play a set number of rounds (e.g., "Best of 5")
3. **Advanced Logic**: Introduce additional options like "lizard" or "Spock" from Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock rules.
4. **Graphics**: Build a GUI version of the game using libraries like `Tkinter` or `Pygame`.

## Notes
- The game is case-insensitive; you can type 'Rock', 'rock' or 'ROCK'.
- If the computer's choice matches yours, it's a tie!
- Have fun and enjoy improving your Python skills through this project!
